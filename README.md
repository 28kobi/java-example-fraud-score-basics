java-example-fraud-score-basics
===============================

Simple code example demonstrating the use of DeployR as a real-time, R analytics scoring engine.

A more complete `example-fraud-score` application can be found [here](https://github.com/deployr/java-example-fraud-score).

## About

This example demonstrates the use of
[DeployR](http://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com) as a real-time, R
analytics scoring engine. The example scenario mimics a real world application where employees at a fictitious bank can request _fraud scores_ for one or more bank account records to help detect fraudulent account activity.

This example is built using the _DeployR_ [RBroker
Framework](http://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com/dev), the simplest way
to integrate R analytics inside any Java, JavaScript or .NET
application. This example consists of two distinct parts:

1. Example R Analytics
2. Example Application

The final section of this document provides additional details regarding the
_DeployR integration_ implemented for this example.

## Example R Analytics

```
Source: analytics/*
```

This example uses an R model built to score fictitious bank account data
to help uncover fraudulent account activity. The model used is found
here:

```
analytics/fraudModel.rData
```

The model uses three variables associated with individual bank accounts:

1. The number of transactions on the account
2. The account balance
3. The credit line on the account

This example makes use of a scoring function that uses the model to help
determine the likelihood of _fraud_ on a given account based on these
data inputs. The scoring function is found here:

```
analytics/ccFraudScore.R
```

The R scripts and data models used by this example application are
bundled by default within the DeployR 7.3 repository, inside the
example-fraud-score directory owned by testuser.

However, if for any reason your DeployR repository does not contain
these files you can add them using the DeployR Repository Manager as
follows:

1. Log in as testuser into the Repository Manager
2. Create a new repository directory called example-fraud-score
3. Upload analytics/fraudModel.rData to the example-fraud-score
   directory
4. Upload analytics/ccFraudScore.R to the example-fraud-score directory


## Example Application


```
Source: src/main/java/com/revo/deployr/rbroker/example/FraudScoreExample.java
```

The example application is implemented as an [RBroker Framework Simulation](http://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com/documents/dev/rbroker/#simulation). This is the simplest way to build, test and verify any DeployR integration.

The application works as follows:

1. Creates an instance of RBroker, representing a pool of R sessions on the DeployR server.
2. Preloads the fraud-score model into the workspace for each R session in the pool.
3. Registers asynchronous callback listeners for task completion and error events in the application.
4. Uses the [Simulation](http://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com/documents/dev/rbroker/#simulation) feature to submit and execute fraud-score tasks on behalf of the application.
5. Releases the instance of RBroker and exits.

We recommend reading the comments provided within the `FraudScoreExample.java` source file for further details. 


## Running the Example

A Gradle build script is provided to run the example:

```
build.gradle
```

By default, the `build.gradle` configuration assumes an instance of the DeployR server
is running on `localhost`. If your instance of DeployR is running at some
other IP address then please udpate the `connection.endpoint` property
in the `build.gradle` file as appropriate.

You do not need to install Gradle before running these commands. To run
this example application on a Unix based OS, run the following shell
script:

```
gradlew run
```


To run this example application on a Windows based OS, run the following
batch file:

```
gradlew.bat run
```

You can observe the console output generated by the application in your terminal window.

## Multiple Users Running the Example

By default, the example build configuration defaults to using *testuser*
account credentials when authenticating with the DeployR server. If two
or more users intend running this example application at the same time
against the same DeployR server instance then:

1. Each user must update the `username` and `password` properties in their
build.gradle configuration file, each indicating the *username* and 
*password* for their own user account.

2. The _Access Control_ setting for each of the example R analytics file
depencencies in the DeployR repository must be changed from _Private_ access
to _Shared_ access.


## DeployR Integration Details

#### R Analytics Dependencies

DeployR-powered applications typically depend on repository-managed R analytics
scripts, models and/or data files. See the _DeployR_ [Repository Manager](http://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com/documents/help/repo-man/) for details on how best to manage your own R analytics dependencies.

This example depends on two repository-managed files:

1. /testuser/example-fraud-score/fraudModel.rData
2. /testuser/example-fraud-score/ccFraudScore.R

Both files, an R model and scoring function respectively, are owned by _testuser_ and can be found in the _example-fraud-score_ repository-managed directory owned by _testuser_.

These example file dependencies ship, pre-deployed in the _DeployR_ repository so there is no further action for you to take in order for this example to use them. Typically a `data scientist` would first develop and then provide these analytics files to an `application developer` for integration.

#### RBroker Framework - Pooled Task Runtime

This examples uses the [RBroker Framework](http://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com/documents/dev/rbroker/) to integrate _DeployR_ real-time scoring capabilities inside the example server application.

Specifically, this example uses the [Pooled Task Runtime](http://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com/documents/dev/rbroker/#pooled) provided by the _RBroker Framework_.

#### RBroker Framework - Throughput

We recommend experimenting with the size of the pool and the number of tasks executed and observe the effects on throughput. Simply update the `example-pool-size` and `simulate-task-size` properties in the `build.gradle` configuration file.

See the following sections of the _RBroker Framework_ 
tutorial for related details:
